In Query B, the top words are more generic or male-associated, including he, him, brother, master, with fewer explicitly medical terms. This suggests that the embeddings have learned gender stereotypes linking women more strongly to caregiving roles and men to professional authority. A plausible explanation is that the training corpus contains news and text where female doctors are more often mentioned alongside nurses or family roles, while male doctors are described more in professional or neutral contexts."

The model learns from co-occurrence patterns, so if women are often mentioned with nurses and men with doctors, the embeddings reflect that. The training objective makes words in similar contexts closer, which reinforces these associations. Over time, common stereotypes in the text become encoded in the vectors. This happens automatically, even though the model isn’t explicitly told to be biased."

First, we identify a bias direction in the embedding space, such as the vector from “man” to “woman.” Then we adjust other word vectors to be neutral along that direction, while keeping their relationships in other dimensions. This reduces gendered or stereotyped associations without destroying the overall structure of the embeddings, and can be applied after training and does not require changing the original corpus."
